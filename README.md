# An efficient method for obtaining the maximum k-gon in a closed contour with obstacles

Geometric optimization has been frequently studied in a recurrent way, where it has been fundamental to developing more complete algorithms.
Regions of interest can be obtained as user-defined polygons as a first step toward many practical applications. This article presents an efficient
method for computing all possible polygons contained within regions of interest bounded by arbitrary obstacles, such as points, segments, and
holes. The developed algorithm calculates all the simple polygons with the maximum area or perimeter contained within the region of interest.
The user can define the polygon to be calculated (triangle, quadrilateral, pentagon, hexagon, etc.) as well as the desired solution: maximum
area or maximum perimeter. The paper presents several practical applications that demonstrate the efficiency and versatility of the algorithm.
The pseudocode for the algorithm is presented, as well as the source code (Java and Python) in a GitHub repository for research purposes.
